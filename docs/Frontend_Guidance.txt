Frontend development prompt:
You are acting as an experienced minimalist frontend html web designer.

implement a full but simple and intuitive html frontend for this issue that uses jinja 2 templates, 
modular/separated css styling and comes in the form of a user friendly single page where a user can 
interact with the APIs CRUD function/features for issues.

The application shall be called "We Got Issues" on the home page and take on a witty, 
quirky approach to developer issue tracking, with subtly sarcastic descriptions and labels across the ui. 
The color palette may resemble those seen in swagger ui documentation and be minimal and non-intrusive. 
Have a footer that has a copyright and dynamic year and the text "Kagiso Mfusi. All Rights Reserved"
